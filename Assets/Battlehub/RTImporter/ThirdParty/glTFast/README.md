*glTFast* enables loading [glTF‚Ñ¢ (GL Transmission Format)][gltf] asset files in [Unity][unity].

It focuses on speed, memory efficiency and a small build footprint.

Two workflows are supported

- Load glTF assets at runtime
- Import glTF assets as prefabs into the asset database at design-time in the Unity Editor

Try the [WebGL Demo][gltfast-web-demo] and check out the [demo project](https://github.com/atteneder/glTFastDemo).

## Features

*glTFast* supports the full [glTF 2.0 specification][gltf-spec] and many extensions. It works with Universal, High Definition and the Built-In Render Pipelines on all platforms.

See all details at the [list of features/extensions](./Documentation~/features.md).

## Installing

The easiest way to install is to download and open the [Installer Package](https://package-installer.glitch.me/v1/installer/OpenUPM/com.atteneder.gltfast?registry=https%3A%2F%2Fpackage.openupm.com&scope=com.atteneder)

It runs a script that installs *glTFast* via a [scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html).

Afterwards *glTFast* and further, optional packages are listed in the *Package Manager* (under *My Registries*) and can be installed and updated from there.

### Optional dependencies

- [Draco 3D Data Compression Unity Package](https://github.com/atteneder/DracoUnity) (provides support for [KHR_draco_mesh_compression](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_draco_mesh_compression))
- [KTX/Basis Texture Unity Package](https://github.com/atteneder/KtxUnity) (in Beta; provides support for [KHR_texture_basisu](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_basisu))

<details><summary>Alternative: Install via GIT URL</summary>

Add *glTFast* via Unity's Package Manager ( Window -> Package Manager ). Click the ‚ûï on the top left and choose *Add package from GIT URL*.

![Package Manager -> + -> Add Package from git URL][upm_install]

Enter the following URL:

`https://github.com/atteneder/glTFast.git`

To add support for Draco mesh compression, repeat the last step and also add the DracoUnity packages using this URL:

`https://gitlab.com/atteneder/DracoUnity.git`

> Note: You have to have a GIT LFS client (large file support) installed on your system. Otherwise you will get an error that the native library file (dll on Windows) is corrupt!

</details>

*glTFast* 2.x requires Unity 2019.3 or newer. For older Unity versions see [Legacy Installation](./Documentation~/gltfast-1.md).

## Usage

You can load a glTF asset from an URL or a file path.

### Runtime Loading via Component

Add a `GltfAsset` component to a GameObject.

![GltfAsset component][gltfasset_component]

### Runtime Loading via Script

```C#
var gltf = gameObject.AddComponent<GLTFast.GltfAsset>();
gltf.url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/master/2.0/Duck/glTF/Duck.gltf";
```

See [Runtime Loading via Script](./Documentation~/glTFast.md#runtime-loading-via-script) in the detailed documentation for instructions how to customize the loading behaviour via script.

#### Customizing Runtime Loading Behavior

The loading behavior can be highly customized:

- Customize [instantiation](./Documentation~/glTFast.md#instantiation)
- Load glTF once and instantiate it many times (see [example](./Documentation~/glTFast.md#custom-post-loading-behaviour))
- Access data of glTF scene (for example get material; see [example](./Documentation~/glTFast.md#custom-post-loading-behaviour))
- Load [reports](./Documentation~/glTFast.md#report) allow reacting and communicating incidents during loading and instantiation
- Tweak and optimize loading performance

See the [Documentation](./Documentation~/glTFast.md) for details.

### Editor Import

To convert your glTF asset into a native Unity prefab, just move/copy it and all its companioning buffer and texture files into the *Assets* folder of your Unity project. It'll get imported into the Asset Database automatically. Select it in the Project view to see detailed settings and import reports in the Inspector. Expand it in the Project View to see the components (Scenes, Meshes, Materials, AnimationClips and Textures) that were imported.

## Project Setup

### Materials and Shader Variants

‚ùó IMPORTANT ‚ùó

*glTFast* uses custom shaders that you **have** to include in builds in order to make materials work. If materials are fine in the Unity Editor but not in builds, chances are some shaders (or variants) are missing.

Read the section *Materials and Shader Variants* in the [Documentation](./Documentation~/glTFast.md#materials-and-shader-variants) for details.

## Roadmap

Find plans for upcoming changes at the [milestones](https://github.com/atteneder/glTFast/milestones).

## Motivation

### Goals

- Stay fast, memory efficient and small
- Feature completeness
  - Support 100% of the glTF 2.0 specification
  - Support all official Khronos extensions
  - Support selected vendor extension
- Universally usable‚Ä¶
  - ‚Ä¶across all popular Unity versions
  - ‚Ä¶across all platforms and devices
  - ‚Ä¶across different project setups (all important render pipelines, GameObject or entity component system based, DOTS, Tiny, etc.)
- Allow customization

### Extended goals

- glTF Authoring (create optimized glTFs from prefabs)
- glTF Runtime Export
